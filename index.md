My name is Ben Mangelsen. I'm currently living in Washington, DC, and I'm actively looking for a junior developer position.

I completed The Iron Yard Back End course on January 17, 2017. During this full-time immersive course, we primarily covered Ruby/Rails, but also HTML/CSS with some JavaScript/Node. My final project was a Rails application which used Rails 5 Action Cable to make use of websockets to create multiplayer Blackjack. In several assignments we also collaborated with the concurrent Front End course to create full-stack applications.
